# monophonic-music-transcription-
this repository includes code from my up coming final project a music transcription program for monophonic instrumants

the codes given here works match better when used with a good microphone 
i left it pretty easy to config the audio api being used 

you are welcome to take the code manipulate as you wish 

i give here 2 functions 
1 a real time pitch estimator 
2 a real time onset detection algorithm

enjoy
