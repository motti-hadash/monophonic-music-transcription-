# monophonic-music-transcription-
this repository includes some of the code from my up coming final project a music transcription program for monophonic instrumants

this codes are only for developmant and testing of the projects algorithms and will be
later implemented in c/c++

the codes given here works much better when used with a good microphone 
i left it pretty easy to config the audio device being used 

you are welcome to take the code and manipulate it as you wish 

i give here 2 functions 
1 a real time pitch estimator 
2 a real time onset detection algorithm

enjoy
